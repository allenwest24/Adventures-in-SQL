# SQL Injection
SQL injection attacks represent a serious threat to any database-driven web site. The
methods behind an attack are easy to learn and the damage caused can range from 
considerable to complete system compromise. Despite these risks, an incredible number 
of systems on the Internet are susceptible to this form of attack.

SQL injection vulnerabilities can easily be exploited and at the same time, with a
little common-sense and forethought, can be almost totally prevented. This challenge 
will show the student a typical example of SQL injection.
